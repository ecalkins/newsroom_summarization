# Newsroom Article Summarization

Final project for Deep Learning course (in progress). The goal of the project is to automatically generate summary text from news articles using a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network architecture. To do this, we are working with a labeled dataset called [Newsroom](https://summari.es/) assembled specifically for this task by phD students at Cornell University.
